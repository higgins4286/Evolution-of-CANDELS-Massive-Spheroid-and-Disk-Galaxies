# Evolution-of-CANDELS-Massive-Spheroid-and-Disk-Galaxies

The term CANDELS stands for Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. The near-infrared images were observed by the Hubble Space 
Telescope and the raw data has been processed and utilized by astronomers around the world. 

My contribution to the project was to select data from the 5 regions of sky observed and compile data sets in terms of key galaxy properties that are 
indicators of galaxy evolution. Each .py file in this repository are the code I wrote that first selects the data from the 5 parent files, then compiles 
the target data types into .txt files that are organized based on the common galaxy parameter rather than the region of sky. These files are then used to 
find evolution trends in the data.
