# Evolution-of-CANDELS-Massive-Spheroid-and-Disk-Galaxies

The term CANDELS stands for Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. The near-infrared images were observed by the Hubble Space 
Telescope and the raw data has been processed and utilized by astronomers around the world. 

My contribution to the project was to select data from the 5 regions of sky observed and compile data sets in terms of key galaxy properties that are 
indicators of galaxy evolution.
